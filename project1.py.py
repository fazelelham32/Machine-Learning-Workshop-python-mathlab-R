# <p align="right">In this exercise, we want to design a category with the help of our knowledge of univariate normal distribution</p>

# # Read data

# <p align="right">First, we read the data from the library and then divide the data into two categories, training and testing</p>

from sklearn import datasets
iris = datasets.load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# store the feature matrix (X) and response vector (y) 
X = iris.data
y = iris.target
print("our dataset has " + str(X.shape[1]) + " features. for more information about data surf the web")
# splitting X and y into training and testing sets
#you can change the test size, fit model with more or less data and see results

print("there is " + str() + " different classes in the dataset")


# # Training a model assuming Gaussian data distributionÿß

# <p align="right">Suppose we know that our data follows a Gaussian distribution and also that the features are independent of each other. Please teach a model for classifying classes with the help of the assumptions of the problem and without the help of ready-made models. Be careful that you should not use ready-made codes and you are only allowed to use ready-made functions for basic formulas such as average or variance.</p>
